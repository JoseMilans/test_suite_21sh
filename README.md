# test_suite_21sh
### Contribute to a test suite for your shell.

## 8. Test suite

Contribute to a test suite for your shell.

This is a task shared by everyone in the class.

* Every team (who contributed) will get the same score for this task (The repository owner will not get more points)
* You have to be pro-active and agree on one and unique repository to use for the test suite
* Please provide the link to the repository you contributed to
* Your contribution must be relevant (Correcting typos is nice and always appreciated on the open source sphere, but we won’t consider this a contribution at this point, unless it fixes a bug)
Guidelines for your test suite repository:

* The test suite should cover every tasks from 0. to 20.
* The test suite should cover every regular cases (many different examples) and possible edge cases
* The entire class should work on the same test suite. Use only one repository (don’t forget the README.md file)
* Start adding tests ASAP and not just before the deadline in order to help everyone from day 0
* You can take (or fork) inspiration from this example, but it is not mandatory to follow this format/way
* Adopt a style and be consistent. You can, for example, follow this style guide. If you choose a style that already exists, add it to the README.md in a style section. If you write your own, create a Wiki page attached to the project and refer to it in the README.md style section.
* * If you choose to use this code, make sure to update the style accordingly
* You should have an AUTHORS file, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. Format, see Docker
Go teams!
